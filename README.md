### It's me! Hi! I'm Apolo, it's me! 👋

Computer Science student at UFRPE and Administration Technician at IFPE (locked due to graduation but I'm going to finish), I've been trying to unify the two worlds of knowledge, something close to the Information Systems course.

🏳️‍🌈 I'm a proud member of LGBTQIA+ programmers community!

Send me a DM on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apolo-albuquerque-994813159) and let's talk!
